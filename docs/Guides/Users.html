      <h1 id="melon-users-guide">Melon Users Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Melon has support for as many users as you want to create. This guide
        will talk about some specifics around users and how to invite new ones.
      </p>
      <h2 id="account-types">Account Types</h2>
      <h4 id="admin-accounts">Admin Accounts</h4>
      <p>
        When you first start Melon, you&#39;ll setup an account username and
        password. This is the first Admin account for the instance. Admin
        accounts can do whatever they please permission wise, so should be given
        out to only trusted individuals.
      </p>
      <h4 id="user-accounts">User Accounts</h4>
      <p>
        User accounts are additional users added to your Melon server. They can
        listen to tracks, make their own playlists, rate songs, and get their
        own stats logging. When a user creates a playlist or a collection or a
        queue, it is considered owned by them, and only visible and editable to
        them. These objects have properties for allowing other users to
        view/edit. Additionally, Admins can bypass these restrictions.
      </p>
      <h4 id="pass-accounts">Pass Accounts</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Pass accounts are currently mostly unused</strong>. These are
        accounts that will be allowed certain endpoints used for Listening
        Parties. For example, sending a link to a friend to generate them a
        temporary &quot;Pass Account&quot;, that only lets them listen along
        with the listening party, and then expires with the listening party.
      </p>
      <h4 id="server-accounts">Server Accounts</h4>
      <p>
        This isn&#39;t technically an account, but it is a user type. This is
        given to JWT that are granted through
        <code>auth/code-authenticate</code>. When you invite a user, you
        generate a code that allows them to call
        <code>auth/code-authenticate</code> on your server. This generates them
        a one time use JWT that is a server account. This allows them to call
        <code>api/users/create</code>, the only api endpoint accessible by
        server accounts. They create their user, then discard the server account
        and login to their newly made one.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-to-invite-someone">How to Invite someone</h2>
      <p>! There are currently no GUI methods for creating new users. !</p>
      <p>
        They way this will work is the inviter will generate an invite code,
        pass it to the new user along with the server url, and then create their
        user. This can be accomplished now by calling <code>auth/invite</code>,
        then <code>auth/code-authenticate</code>, and then using the JWT to call
        <code>api/users/create</code>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="user-properties">User properties</h2>
      <p>
        Users have a few properties they can set. They can set a Bio and
        Favorite Track/Album/Artist. You can also choose if your stats are
        public, aka viewable by other users.
      </p>
      <h2 id="user-friends">User Friends</h2>
      <p>! This feature is not fully implemented !</p>
      <p>
        Users can add other users on the server as friends. This will bypass the
        restrictions for viewing their stats (but not their
        playlists/collections).
      </p>
      <h2 id="username-password-changes">Username / Password changes</h2>
      <p>
        <code>api/users</code> exposes endpoints for changing your current
        Username and Password. If you need to change your Username or Password,
        you need a valid JWT. These last for an hour, so if you&#39;ve logged in
        over the past hour your current one will still do. Once you&#39;ve
        changed your Username or Password, all your JWT tokens will become
        invalid and you&#39;ll need to login with your new credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not know / have access to your password anymore, an Admin
        account can override the JWT restriction and change your password for
        you. (Note, in the future I&#39;d like Admins to be able to distribute
        an Invite Token style code to let users change their password on their
        own, so the admin doesn&#39;t need to know the password to change it)
