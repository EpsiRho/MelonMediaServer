        WebSocket Architecture Documentation

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The WebSocket system in this architecture provides real-time
        communication between clients. It is primarily designed to manage
        client-to-client controls, where a user on one device (like a phone) can
        control playback or the queue on another device (like a TV).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>StreamManager</code> class is the core of this WebSocket
        system, responsible for managing active WebSocket connections,
        processing incoming messages, sending responses, and handling tasks such
        as updating play queues and sending commands across devices. Client
        connections are stored as <a href="/models/WSS.html">WSS</a> objects.
      </p>

      <h3 id="establishing-a-connection">Establishing a Connection</h3>
      <p>
        When a new WebSocket connection is initiated, it is handled by the
        <code>AddSocket</code> method in <code>StreamManager</code>. This
        method:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creates a new <code>WSS</code> object.</li>
        <li>Adds the WebSocket session to the <code>Sockets</code> list.</li>
        <li>
          Begins handling incoming WebSocket messages asynchronously using the
          <code>HandleWebSocketAsync</code> method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Starts managing the connection via <code>ManageSocket</code>, which
          handles ping checks and connection closures.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The server will send a PING message out on the connection every 2
              minutes, and if it isn&#39;t responded to by a PONG message, then
              the server will consider the client dead and disconnect from it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="managing-websocket-connections">
        Managing WebSocket Connections
      </h2>
      <p>
        WebSocket connections are monitored for activity. The server pings each
        connection at intervals to ensure it is still active. If a client fails
        to respond after a specific duration, the connection is closed.
      </p>
      <h3 id="ping-pong-mechanism">Ping-Pong Mechanism</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The server sends a <strong>PING</strong> every two minutes to each
          connected WebSocket.
        </li>
        <li>
          The client must respond with a <strong>PONG</strong> message within
          the next minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          If no <strong>PONG</strong> is received, the server closes the
          connection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="sending-commands">Sending Commands</h3>
      <p>
        Once a WebSocket is connected, the
        <code>HandleWebSocketAsync</code> method listens for incoming messages.
        The system supports a variety of commands:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GET QUEUE</strong>: Request to retrieve the current queue id
          associated with this session/client.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>GET QUEUE</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SET QUEUE</strong>: Sets the queue for the session.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>SET QUEUE:66bc99b8ab7ba419497e21af</code></li>
            <li>
              Clients should send this command anytime they change the queue
              they are playing back from.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SET DEVICE</strong>: Sets the name of the device controlled by
          this WebSocket.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>SET Device:Epsi&#39;s Phone</code></li>
            <li>
              Clients are not given a name by default, and are not findable
              without one. Client should send this message once after
              connecting, and again anytime the user wants to change the
              client&#39;s name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Client names MUST be unique, and the server will respond on the
              WebSocket with <code>Device Name Taken</code> if you try to set a
              duplicate name.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SET PUBLIC</strong>: Makes the WebSocket connection publicly
          accessible or private.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>SET PUBLIC:true</code></li>
            <li>
              This makes the client&#39;s WebSocket session visible. Clients can
              use the <a href="/api/Stream.html">Stream</a> API endpoints to see
              visible connections and send commands to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Returns <code>DEVICE IS PUBLIC:true</code> indicating success and
              the current value.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SEND PROGRESS</strong>: Begins sending media scanning
          progress.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>SEND PROGRESS</code></li>
            <li>
              Clients can choose to have scan progress sent down the WebSocket
              for Realtime updates, instead of calling
              <a href="/api/Scan.html#get-scan-progress">api/scan/progress</a> and getting progress from
              one point in time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Response progress updates will return every 100ms ish and look
              like
              <code
                >PROGRESS:&lt;Num of Scanned Files&gt;:&lt;Num of Total Files to
                Scan&gt;</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              It will also send a progress info response anytime the status
              string changes, and will look like
              <code>PROGRESS INFO:Scanning track metadata</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>STOP PROGRESS</strong>: Stops the progress updates.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: <code>STOP PROGRESS</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="client-to-client-communication">
        Client-to-Client Communication
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the key features of the WebSocket system is enabling
        <strong>client-to-client communication</strong>. For example, a user
        might use their phone to control media playback on a TV. This is done
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Identifying the device</strong>: Each device has a name that
          is registered with the WebSocket.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sending commands</strong>: Commands can be sent to a WebSocket
          by using the <a href="/api/Stream.html">Stream</a> API endpoints, and are
          received by the desired client over it&#39;s WebSocket. Those commands
          are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              PLAY: will look like
              <code>PLAY QUEUE:66bc99b8ab7ba419497e21af</code> where the right
              side of <code>:</code> is the queue the client should attempt to
              play.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the queue is the same as the one already playing, resume
                  playback instead of swapping queues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              PAUSE: will look like <code>PAUSE</code> and should tell the
              client to pause playback
            </li>
            <li>
              SKIP: will look like <code>SKIP</code> and should tell the client
              to skip to the next song
            </li>
            <li>
              REWIND: will look like <code>REWIND</code> and is supposed to tell
              the client to go back a song, but may also instead rewind the
              current track and require a second rewind call to go back a song.
            </li>
            <li>
              VOLUME: will look like <code>VOLUME:20</code> where the volume the
              client should set to is on the right side of the <code>:</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              QUEUE UPDATE: will look like <code>UPDATE QUEUE</code> and tells
              the client that the queue has changed in some way, so it should
              reload it&#39;s info.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This is done by calling AlertQueueUpdate() anytime a queue is
                  impacted by an API.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
