      <h1 id="playlists">Playlists</h1>
      <p>
        Playlists are lists of tracks that users can create and edit. When
        created they are marked as &quot;owned&quot; by the user that first
        created it. By default, playlists are not visible to other users other
        than the original creator, and they are not editable either. This can be
        changed by adding user ids to viewers and editors, or by making the
        playlist viewable/editable publicly (by any user).
      </p>
      <p>
        Playlists come with a Name, a Description, and an Artwork that can be
        set to customize it&#39;s appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Playlists can return their contents either by tracks, by the albums
        contained, or by the artists contained. If returning their contents by
        album or artist, the tracks are ignored and the full album/artist object
        is returned, as if all tracks from said album/artist were in the
        playlist.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is currently no way in the Console menu to create playlists
        manually, but you can Import/Export them in the Database Settings (see
        <a href="Guides/Configure">Configure</a>). These import/export as either
        m3u, pls, or xml.
      </p>
      <h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>
      <p>
        Collections are like playlists that are automatically managed based on
        set filters. Everything else about them works exactly them same. A
        collection&#39;s tracks are updated anytime a new filter is added or
        anytime the database is scanned. Collections can also be exported in the
        console, but not imported, since they are designed to be automatically
        generated.
      </p>
      <h3 id="filters">Filters</h3>
      <p>
        Collections use filters find tracks to add to themselves. They use the
        same filters as <a href="api/Search">Search</a> uses to find tracks.
        Filters look like this: <code>property;comparison;value</code>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Property is any property from a
          <a href="models/Track">Track</a> model. For example,
          <code>Genre</code>, <code>Artist</code>, <code>Ratings</code>,
          <code>Name</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comparison is the type of comparing you want to match the property to
          the value. This can be <code>Contains</code>, <code>Eq</code>,
          <code>NotEq</code>, <code>Lt</code>, or <code>Gt</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Value is the value to compare, for example a string or a number.
          Examples:
        </li>
        <li><code>Artist;Eq;Madeon</code></li>
        <li><code>Ratings;Gt;4</code></li>
        <li><code>Year;Lt;2010</code></li>
      </ul>
