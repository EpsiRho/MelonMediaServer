      <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>Installing Melon is super easy, but it requires a few Prerequisite.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You need .NET 8.0, which you can get
          <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">Here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          You&#39;ll need a
          <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community">MongoDB</a>
          instance to connect the server to, so spin one up either through atlas
          or locally before running the server.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once you have both of these things up and running, navigate to the
          GitHub Releases page for the
          <a href="https://github.com/EpsiRho/MelonMediaServer/releases"
            >MelonMediaServer</a
          >
          project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here, go to the latest release and download the
          <strong>installer.zip</strong> file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once it&#39;s downloaded, either run the exe (Windows) or the dll
          (Linux) and it will ask for the path to the folder you want to install
          to. Once it&#39;s done it will close.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to where you install Melon and run the MelonWebApi.(exe/dll)
          application. This will launch the server and launch the Console UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the console UI is fully loaded it will take you through an Out Of
          Box setup experience.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Here you&#39;ll set up your Admin account&#39;s Username and
              Password, link Melon to your MongoDb instance, and link to the
              folders you store your music files in.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you&#39;re out of the setup, you&#39;ll be left at the console
          menu. You can use your arrow keys + enter to navigate. You&#39;ll want
          to start a scan as soon as possible, as no songs will be available in
          your library until a scan has completed.
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have the choice between Full and Short scan, but for a first
              scan they will both end up being full scans. This is because the
              short scan skips files that haven&#39;t been modified since last
              scan.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Installation is complete! But there are a few more things to configure.
      </p>
      <h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may need to port forward to the PC/Server you&#39;re hosting Melon
          on. The port Melon uses by default is 14524, but you can change the
          port by setting the listening URL in the Console Settings UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTTPS allows Melon to send traffic securely, and some clients /
          devices may require it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              To setup HTTPS, follow the setup UI in the console under Network
              Settings -&gt; Configure HTTPS.
            </li>
            <li>
              You&#39;ll need an SSL cert, which you can get through
              <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">CertBot</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              SSL Certs expire, but Melon will inform you if your cert is
              expired on startup, or when you visit the HTTPS settings
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
