            <p>Melon is a media server that scans your music files and lets you stream them. This project is focused on
                including lots of customization and functionality to make this the best way to view, manage, and listen
                to
                your local music library.</p>

                <li>Shuffle Modes:<ul>
                        <li>Shuffle your music randomly, prioritize your favorite tracks, prioritize track discovery,
                            group
                            tracks by album, and group tracks by artist.</li>
                        <li>Track Links keep tracks that flow back to back next to each other in shuffled queues (For
                            example: Nirvana -&gt; Mania from Madeon&#39;s Good Faith album).</li>

                <li>Multiple Queues:<ul>
                        <li>Melon keeps track of queues on all your devices. So you can pick up where you left off when
                            moving to a different device, control queues playing on other devices, and save queues for
                            later.</li>
                        <li>Queues are removed after a controllable time (Default 48 hours), unless they are favorited.

                            with

            <h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>
            <p>There are currently no clients for Melon, but two are planned. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Galia, the Windows application written with the WASDK.<ul>
                        <li>Galia&#39;s code is currently closed during early dev, but will be up on GitHub soon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Watermelon, the iOS application written with Swift.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Work has already begun on the windows application. When I have completed the Galia and Watermelon apps, I
                will work on more first-party apps as I can, hoping to get apps on MacOS, AppleTV, and Android. I
                personally
                do not want to work on a Web App, I just dislike working in JS, so there will likely not be one
                first-party.
            </p>
            <h3 id="where-to-start-building-apps">Where to start building apps</h3>
            <p>All endpoints require authentication except for logging in, so <a href="/api/Authorization.html">auth</a>
                is a
                good
                place to start. </p>
            <p>Once you&#39;ve obtained a JWT, a good way to test the API is with <a href="/api/Search.html">search</a>
                endpoints.
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the endpoints can be found at the <a href="/api/EndpointsOverview.html">Endpoints
                    Overview</a> and
                models can be found at <a href="/models/modelsOverview.html">Models Overview</a>.</p>
