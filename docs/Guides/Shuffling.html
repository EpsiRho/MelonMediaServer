        <h1 id="shuffling">Shuffling</h1>
        <p>Melon provides a couple options for Shuffling tracks in the API. These options are designed to bring shuffle
            modes for any situation or personal desires. </p>
        <h2 id="shuffle-modes">Shuffle Modes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>TrackRandom<ul>
                    <li>Shuffle tracks randomly, using a randomization algorithm designed to make things feel more
                        random than actual random.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>TrackFullRandom<ul>
                    <li>Shuffles tracks randomly, without using an algorithm. Full chaos.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>TrackFavorites<ul>
                    <li>Shuffles tracks weighted based on characteristics that will make the top of the queue more
                        likely to be your favorites. </li>
                    <li>Uses track plays and rating to determine the weight</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>TrackDiscovery<ul>
                    <li>Shuffles tracks weighted based on characteristics that will make the top of the queue more
                        likely to be songs you rarely hear or haven&#39;t listen to.</li>
                    <li>Uses track plays to weigh against songs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Album<ul>
                    <li>Orders tracks by album, for example a playlist with randomly inserted songs from 5 albums will
                        order them from album 1-5, playing songs in their album order before moving to the next album.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AlbumRandom<ul>
                    <li>Groups track by album, then shuffles the album order around. Plays each album&#39;s songs in
                        album order.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ArtistRandom<ul>
                    <li>Groups tracks by artist, then shuffles the artists around and plays them in &quot;artist
                        order&quot; (by release date)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="track-links">Track Links</h2>
        <p>You can enable or disable the use of Track Links in shuffling. Track Links are a property on Tracks called
            <code>NextTrack</code>. This property can hold the id of another track, linking them together. When two
            tracks that are linked together appear in a queue that&#39;s being shuffled, they are placed at random, but
            forced to play back to back. This is for those songs that are designed to play back to back, or ones you
            just can&#39;t listen to without hearing the other. </p>
        <p>Track Links are set by an Admin account but they affect every user, unless other users disable track links
            during shuffling.</p>
